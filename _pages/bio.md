I am a Research Scientist at [Google AI](https://ai.google/) based in Mountain View, California. I am working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning research. 

Previously, I obtained my PhD from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I did my PhD under the A\*Star Graduate Scholarship, supervised by Prof [Hui Siu Cheung](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asschui/) (@ NTU), Dr [Luu Anh Tuan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tuanluu/) (previously @ A\*Star, now at MIT CSAIL) and Dr [Su Jian](http://www.colips.org/~sujian/) (@ A\*Star, I2R) where I was affiliated with the Baidu I2R Research Center working on NLP research. I was also a visiting research scientist at A\*STAR from June 2019 to October 2019. Before pursuing a PhD, I earned my Bachelors in Engineering (Computer Science) from NTU, Singapore in 2015.

Fun Fact: I also obtained an [associate diploma](https://www.trinitycollege.com/site/?id=1587) in classical piano performance from Trinity College London in 2012.
