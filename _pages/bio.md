I am a Research Scientist at [Google AI](https://ai.google/) based in Mountain View, California. I am working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning research. You can find my Google Research homepage [here](https://research.google/people/106722/).

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from NTU, Singapore. I did my PhD under the A\*Star Graduate Scholarship, supervised by Prof [Hui Siu Cheung](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asschui/) (@ NTU), Dr [Luu Anh Tuan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tuanluu/) (previously @ A\*Star, now at MIT CSAIL) and Dr [Su Jian](http://www.colips.org/~sujian/) (@ A\*Star, I2R) where I was affiliated with the Baidu I2R Research Center working on NLP research. 

My thesis was entitled *Neural Architectures for Natural Language Understanding*, which proposed neural models and achieved new state-of-the-art (at that time) across a spectrum of NLU problems such as reading comprehension, question answering and natural language inference. Notably, my thesis also won the outstanding PhD thesis award (best thesis out of *all* graduating PhDs in the year 2020) at NTU SCSE. 

For a brief transition period, I was also a visiting research scientist at A\*STAR from June 2019 to October 2019 where I worked on fundamental ML/DL research. Before pursuing a PhD, I earned my Bachelors in Engineering (Computer Science) from NTU, Singapore in 2015.

I am fortunate to have won best paper award (runner-up) at WSDM 2020, along with several prizes at data science competitions such as CIKM Cup 2016 (1st place) and 2017 (4th place). I also won first place at CVPR VQA Challenge 2017. 

Pertaining to research, I largely identify with the NeurIPS/ACL/EMNLP communities although I also publish frequently in Information Retrieval and Data Mining conferences (WSDM/KDD/WWW etc). I have also served as a regular program committee to almost all top tier conferences these areas. I also served as Area Chair for EMNLP 2020.

Fun Fact: I also obtained an [associate diploma](https://www.trinitycollege.com/site/?id=1587) in classical piano performance from Trinity College London in 2012.

## Personal

* I am Singaporean and happily married to [Vanessa Chew](https://www.instagram.com/vcnes5sa/). The origin of my online persona (github id, vanzytay) is the fusion of our names.
* I wish I could say more about work life balance.
* I enjoy classical music and classical piano, especially works of Chopin, Liszt and Beethoven. I used to practice a lot, and enjoy tackling Chopin and Liszt etudes. I don't actively practice anymore but I still enjoy listening to awesome classical music every now and then.
