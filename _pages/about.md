Hi! I am currently a fourth-year PhD candidate @ Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore. My research interests are mainly in the areas of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am interested in designing efficient and effective neural models for language understanding.

I mainly work on applications involving natural language understanding, question answering and information retrieval. Previously, I was affiliated with the Baidu-I2R Centre at the Institute for Infocomm Research as an A\*Star scholar.

*Update: I have defended my PhD thesis and will join Google as a Research Scientist @ Mountain View in November.*
