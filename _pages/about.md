Hi! I am a Research Scientist at [Google AI](https://ai.google/) working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Research. I am currently based in Mountain View, California. Before joining Google, I earned my PhD (Computer Science) and B.Eng (Computer Science) from NTU, Singapore in 2019 and 2015 respectively. During my PhD, I worked on deep learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence. You can find my Google Research homepage [here](https://research.google/people/106722/).
