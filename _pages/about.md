Hi! I am a Research Scientist at Google working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Research.

I obtained my PhD (Computer Science) and B.Eng (Computer Science) from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore in 2019 and 2015 respectively. During my PhD, I worked on deep learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence.
